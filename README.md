# automated-resume-relevance-scoring-n8n
Automated ATS-style resume relevance scoring workflow built in n8n. The system reads resumes from Google Drive, extracts text, validates details, handles OCR fallback for unreadable resumes, merges resume + job-description text, evaluates relevance using AI, and automatically updates Google Sheets with score, reasoning, and candidate status.
